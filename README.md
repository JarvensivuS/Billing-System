# Billing-System
Thesis work of my vocational studies in Omnia, Espoo. 
The idea is that you can print the same bill to multiple people by loading a csv file containing the information of the customers and be able to quickly change the personal information from the buttons. All that is required is a new bill number and that will generate a reference number for each bill accordingly.
Unfortunately i did not save the source code and only the exe file remains. 
Written in Java using the Swing library for the ui.

User is able to choose a csv file containing the name, address informations and email of the payers and can swap the customer information by using the buttons.

We can add the products, amount of each product, price per one item and the tax after which it calculates the price for us.

After the products have been added we fill he payees information, see our total price (in this case 1574.6e) and are ready to print the bill.
