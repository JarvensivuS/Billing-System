# Billing-System
Thesis work of my Vocational studies in Omnia. 
The idea was that you can send the same bill to multiple payers by loading a csv file containing the information of the customers.
Unfortunately i didnt save the source code and only the exe file remains. 
Written in Java.
# 
Payee/User is able to choose a csv file containing the name, address informations and email of the payers and verifying the info using the two buttons.
